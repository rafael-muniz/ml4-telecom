# Machine Learning project 4 - Logistic Regression for Predicting Customer Churn in the Telecom Sector

<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utilization of machine learning is an important aspect of supporting businesses by garnering insights that form data-driven solutions. In constantly evolving and competitive industries, machine learning presents solutions by classifying and predicting customer outcomes. For example, in the telecommunications industry, an important metric is customer churn, where existing customers cease to use a companyâ€™s services and products, leave the company and explore alternatives offered by competitors. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, three algorithms - Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors models - are explored to understand the classification and prediction of churn for a telecommunications company. In turn, based on the accuracy score, Logistic Regression is the most effective model for predicting customer churn with an accuracy of 80%.</div>
